The client was Gaming Room and they wanted to create a game that was called Draw It or Lose It. They wanted to design their game so it could be used on any mobile device, tablet, etc.

I think that I described the differences between the different operating platforms particularly well, I was able to determine which one would be the best to use between Linux, Windows or Mac.

I think that using the design document helped in writing code because it assisted in having the base for the code that was needed, and gave a nice foundation of how to write the code in question.

I think that I could have done a better job with the UML diagram.

When you consider the user's needs the finished product reflects it because if the application or whatever you are developing is based off the user's needs it will tend to be more user-friendly and will function more fluently.

I think that creating diagrams is a good way to get a good base of how code is able to function, a UML diagram for instance will reflect the different cases that you need to develop in the code.
